hello-polymer
=============

Sample program using miraj.html and polymer.paper.  Based on a vanilla
compojure app.


== Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Configuration

Following the instructions at
link:https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/start/getting-the-code.html[Get
the Polymer Library], install Bower.

In `resources/public`, run `$ bower install`.  The `bower.json` file
in that directory will control bower; the result will be a bunch of
polymer resources in `resources/public/bower_components`.

If you want to add polymer components, go to the link:https://elements.polymer-project.org/[online Polymer catalog], find the Bower command you need, and execute it from `resources/public`.  For example, to install `iron-icon`, the command is `bower install --save PolymerElements/iron-icon`.

*CAVEAT:* if you use Polymer elements in your webpage without installing the Polymer components using bower you will not get a warning.  Your webpage just won't work.  Always check the network downloads to see if you're asking for a Polymer component that hasn't been installed.

From the project root directory, start a web server for the application:

    lein ring server  (or lein ring server-headless)

Access the app at `localhost:3000`
